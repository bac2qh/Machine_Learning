Problem 1
1. the response time data is not available for the Vacant/Abandoned Buildings because there is no completion date 
2. the Graffiti removal is the most common type of request among the three studied 
3. there is no subtype specified for Alley Light Out requests 
4. community area 24 (west town, Chicago) has most request in the past 
5. it takes much longer for city to respond to Alley Light Out requests than for the Graffiti Removal Requests
