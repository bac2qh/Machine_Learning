I am giving you points for this but as I say in my comments,
you were supposed to write a function to do this, which you
should have then called in your jupyter notebook.

Explore
4.5/9
I guess you in fact do some exploring in the notebook. But you
did not write functions for this.
See comments above.

Preprocess

I dont see you doing this anywhere.

For the discretize_cont_var function, instead of fixing
the suffix of the new col name to be "_group" you should
have the function take in the suffix as an argument.
For the binary variable case/dummies, your function should
follow the same kind of steps you do for discretize_cont_var,
where you add the new column to the input dataframe.
Consistency is always good!

The notebook submitted is extremely sloppy and does not present
your findings in a coherent manner. It is not enough to just
splat out plots in the cells and other random things like
a stream of falses without any discussion on what youre doing
what you've discovered, etc.:
"False
 False
 False
 False
 False
 False
 False
 False
 False
 False
 False
 False
 False"
In fact it seems the only thing youve reported is the bit on
precision/recall at the very end of the notebook.
It is not enough to say that "accuracy, precision and recall are good metrics". Why are they good
metrics? It is okay if you're not sure. But these are important
things to think about, and we want you to practice
asking yourself these questions.

I think you misunderstood the assignment. A big chunk of the
assignment was to write functions that you will be able to use
for processing new datasets going forward. Yes, there was also
a component for doing the same kind of data exploration you did
for assigment 1 and for fitting a classifier to the data + evaluating it so I can give you some
points.
